## üìñ Objectives

1. **Design and Implementation of a Low-Pass Filter:**
   - Design an RC low-pass filter with a specified cutoff frequency.
   - Analyze the filter's response to different input signals.
   - Compare theoretical and practical results.

2. **Sampling and Signal Processing:**
   - Sample sine wave signals at different frequencies.
   - Implement data acquisition using Arduino and visualize the signals in MATLAB.
   - Identify aliasing effects and frequency distortions.

3. **Fourier Analysis and Windowing:**
   - Perform Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis on sampled signals.
   - Apply windowing techniques (Hanning window) to reduce spectral leakage.
   - Compare filtered signals with theoretical models.
