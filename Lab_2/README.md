## üìñ Objectives

1. **LED and LDR Control System:**
   - Combine an LED blinking circuit with an LDR sensor.
   - Adjust LED brightness dynamically based on ambient light.
   - Implement timer-based control using interrupts.

2. **Digital Stopwatch:**
   - Develop a stopwatch using push buttons for start, stop, and reset functions.
   - Implement debouncing techniques to avoid false triggers.
   - Display elapsed time in minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.

3. **Rotary Encoder Measurement:**
   - Measure angular displacement and velocity using an optical encoder.
   - Count pulses to track position and speed.
   - Display real-time measurements.
