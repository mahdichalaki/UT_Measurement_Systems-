## üìñ Project Overview

### Objective

The goal of this lab is to gain hands-on experience with sensor-based measurements and control systems using Arduino. The experiment includes:

1. **LED Blinking Task:**
   - Control an LED using an Arduino board.
   - Implement a simple blinking pattern with a 1-second interval.
   - Understand digital pin configuration and time delays.

2. **Light Sensor-based LED Control:**
   - Utilize a **photoresistor (LDR)** to control LED brightness.
   - Implement a voltage divider circuit to measure light intensity.
   - Dynamically adjust LED brightness based on ambient lighting conditions.
