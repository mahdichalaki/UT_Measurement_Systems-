## üìñ Objectives

1. **Low-Pass Filter Design and Implementation:**
   - Design a low-pass RC filter with a specific cutoff frequency.
   - Use an adjustable resistor to fine-tune the circuit to achieve the desired frequency response.
   - Analyze the filter's effect on sinusoidal signals of varying frequencies.

2. **Sinusoidal Signal Generation:**
   - Generate sinusoidal signals using Arduino with different frequencies.
   - Implement user-controlled frequency adjustment via a push button.
   - Record and analyze the signals in MATLAB for further processing.

3. **Experimental Verification:**
   - Compare theoretical and experimental frequency responses of the filter.
   - Analyze signal attenuation across different frequencies.
   - Evaluate the impact of circuit imperfections and noise on results.
